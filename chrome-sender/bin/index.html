    <div class="instruction-panel">
      <h3>
        Instructions:
      </h3>
      <li><b>Recommended:</b> Try the mobile apps for SpellCast to gain some context for the explanations below.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have the Google cast extension installed.</li>
      <li>Cast this tab to the Cast device.</li>
      <li>
        Open chrome dev console by pressing <span class="code-key">F12</span>
        on a PC or <span class="code-key">Cmd</span> +
        <span class="code-key">Opt</span> +
        <span class="code-key">I</span> on a Mac and start below.
      </li>

      <h3>
        How does this work?
      </h3>
      <p>
        After opening the chrome dev console, you will see a list of available
        commands that can be used to control the app. In this demo, we will
        operate the app through the dev console command line to give you some
        insight on how the code works.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the app is casted to the receiver device, you should see a screen
        saying "Waiting for wizards to join".  We'll begin by sending a "player
        available" message to the receiver by doing the following:
        <div class="code">
          sendPlayerAvailable(null, null)
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you don't have to provide a player name to send a players
        available request. When you leave the <span class="code">playerId</span>
        blank, the SDK will automatically generate a player name and attach it
        to your sender. If there is already a playerId associated with your
        sender device, then leaving the playerId field blank will assume the
        ID of the already associated player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's now send a special game message that SpellCast knows about to
        show a debug UI (notice the first parameter is null to use the
        already associated playerId):
        <div class="code">
          sendGameMessage(null, {debug: true})
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, you see a debug UI showing player information but
        no actual player in the game screen. This is because although the
        receiver knows of our availability, we have not readied our player
        with name and avatar information. We
        can ready our player with the function
        <span class="code">
          sendPlayerReady(<i>playerId</i>, <i>playerReadyData</i>)
        </span>.
        For your convenience, this demo contains functions to help you make data
        objects you might need for game messages.  Let's create the player
        ready data and set the name and avatar:
        <div class="code">
          var playerReadyData = createSpellcastPlayerReadyData();<br/>
          playerReadyData.playerName='your_name_here';<br/>
          playerReadyData.avatarIndex=0;<br/>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now ready our player by doing:
        <div class="code">
          sendPlayerReady(null, playerReadyData);
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your player should now appear on the screen ready to cast spells!
        We can begin the game by sending a "player playing"
        message to tell the game to start. We can do this with:
        <div class="code">
          sendPlayerPlaying(null, createSpellcastPlayerPlayingData());
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        You should now be taken to the instructions screen where the game loads,
        and then be taken to the spell casting screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game now waits for players to input spells. Let's create 3 spells:
        <div class="code">
          // First spell.<br>
          var spell1 = createSpellcastSpell();<br>
          spell1.spellType = 1;<br>
          spell1.spellElement = 2;<br>
          spell1.spellAccuracy = 1;<br>
          <br>
          // Second spell.<br>
          var spell2 = createSpellcastSpell();<br>
          spell2.spellType = 1;<br>
          spell2.spellElement = 3;<br>
          spell2.spellAccuracy = 1;<br>
          <br>
          // Third spell.<br>
          var spell3 = createSpellcastSpell();<br>
          spell3.spellType = 1;<br>
          spell3.spellElement = 4;<br>
          spell3.spellAccuracy = 1;<br>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we have made the spell, we can add the spells to an array and pass
        the array to a new spell message.  We can then send the message to the
        game which will perform our spell actions.
        <div class="code">
          var spellMessage =
          createSpellcastSpellMessage([spell1, spell2, spell3]);<br>
          sendGameMessage(null, spellMessage);<br>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, your wizard on screen will fire three magic spells to the
        enemy, and the enemy will attack back. Once the enemy's turn is over,
        you can send more spells and repeat until either your wizard or the
        enemy dies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this sample app we explored how to control a game by directly
        calling functions provided by the Game Manager API.  By
        attaching a well designed user interface that triggers these Game
        Manager API functions, you could make a game just like SpellCast!
